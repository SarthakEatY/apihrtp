This protocol, aimed at early detection of clinical deterioration, was put into practice from July 2021 to December 2023 in the hospital's Unit C. It involves scoring patients based on predefined criteria such as oxygen saturation, respiratory and heart rates, and body temperature, to identify those at risk of health deterioration and prevent cardiopulmonary arrest. The implementation has led to a significant reduction in emergency codes being triggered, with a 48% decrease in the activation of the Code Red for early deterioration risk and no need to activate the Code Blue for cardiopulmonary arrest in the last four months of the project. The initiative has been deemed a success, with the protocol now firmly integrated into the routine practices of all professionals in the unit.",

Around the age of 5, after stabilizing her asthmatic crises, she was able to start running and playing, significantly improving her quality of life. Her mother, Ra\u00edssa, faced significant emotional and financial challenges during this period, including being fired for missing work to take care of Giovana. The experience led Ra\u00edssa to create an NGO to support other families facing similar problems.

This new institute, which will also integrate parts of the organizational chart of the Ministry of Health and Consumption, is part of the efforts to streamline the public sector and improve efficiency in management. The measure has generated criticism from Por Andaluc\u00eda and CCOO, who see behind it intentions to cover up poor management and privatize services. The Health Institute will adopt the legal form of an Administrative Agency and will aim to promote research, innovation, and excellence in healthcare, among other things. It will have staff from different categories and is expected to boost biomedical and health sciences research in the region.",

In Spain, 6.8% of minors and adolescents meet the clinical criteria for ADHD, with about 3% of the adult population also affected. Despite ADHD being primarily diagnosed in childhood, symptoms can persist into adulthood. The article raises questions about whether societal changes, such as the fast pace of life and the pervasive use of technology, may contribute to behaviors previously considered normal in children now being labeled as ADHD. It also addresses the issues of both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis, highlighting the importance of accurate diagnosis by experienced specialists. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for greater understanding of ADHD to distinguish between genuine psychological/psychiatric issues and the impact of societal pressures.",

Only Catalonia and the Basque Country have a ratio of psychiatrists above the recommended one. The lack of capacity to attract and retain professionals in the public system is a significant problem, with calls to improve working conditions. More than 1,500 professionals gather at the National Congress of Psychiatry in Salamanca to discuss these challenges.

Too much use of technology is now seen as a new thing that could make children more likely to be obese, which is over 40% in the country, and also lead to being alone, feeling depressed, having trouble sleeping, doing things too much like being on the internet, being bullied online, and seeing things they shouldn't like pornography. The AEP says it's important to not use screens too much for all ages, and suggests that kids under two should mostly just make video calls with their family. Kids aged three to five should only watch screens for less than an hour a day and it should be good quality shows. Kids from six to nine should move around and play for at least an hour a day and not spend too much time on screens. The guide also talks about how important it is for parents to be involved and set a good example with how they use their own digital devices to help their kids develop healthy habits.",

This advancement is greatly appreciated by the medical community, including the Spanish Pain Society (SED), which views it as a major progress for patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain or cancer pain, among other conditions. The regulation process gained momentum after a draft ministerial order was prepared by the State Agency for Medicines and Health Products (AEMPS) and is now under the supervision of M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda's department. This initiative followed a congressional subcommittee on medicinal cannabis's decision in June 2022 to regulate its therapeutic use. The AEMPS was charged with implementing the recommendations within six months, with the goal of making medicinal cannabis available through pharmacies. The forthcoming regulation, expected in the next few months, is anticipated to be a significant breakthrough in providing additional therapeutic options for patients.",

    "summary": "Chronic pain affects one in four Spaniards, about 26% of the population, a figure that is increasing according to the Chronic Pain Barometer in Spain. Chronic pain is defined as pain that is continuous for more than four days a week and lasts for more than three months. It affects both men and women, with a higher incidence in women, and can occur in various body parts, leading to disabling consequences. Dr. Mar\u00eda Madariaga, an anesthesiologist and pain specialist, notes that although chronic pain is often associated with degenerative pain in older individuals, it predominantly affects people around the age of 50. The social understanding of chronic pain is limited because it is not externally visible. The most common sources of chronic pain are musculoskeletal, joint, and mechanical origins, often starting with inflammation. It typically affects major joints, especially the lumbar region of the spine and knees. Chronic pain can be treated either as a symptom, which is successful when the injury heals, or as a chronic disease, which becomes more complex when it affects the nervous system. Primary chronic pain, intense, chronic, and generalized without a specific injury, is the most prevalent among the population.",

Variations in sexual desire, orgasm, ejaculation, and arousal could indicate health issues.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is often associated with cardiovascular problems and can signal conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or high cholesterol. The link between ED and diabetes, which impacts vascular function and nerve transmission necessary for an erection, is well-established. Moreover, sexual issues can also suggest neurological disorders or benign prostatic hyperplasia.

However, easier access to information online and campaigns aimed at women are encouraging men to seek help more often and sooner.

It's important for men to stay away from fake experts and dubious products, as ED can be an early warning sign of serious illnesses like diabetes.

The II Meeting of the shared care and interconsultation group of the Galician Society of Internal Medicine, organized by Meijide, focused on abdominal, colon cancer, and hepatobiliary-pancreatic surgeries, highlighting the need for patients to be well-prepared beforehand. Shared care not only reduces hospital stays but also improves surgical outcomes by addressing pre-existing medical issues and potential post-operative complications. It is suggested that nearly all surgical patients could benefit from shared care, which takes into account various factors including mental health, frailty, and polypharmacy, before and after surgery.",

It increases the calories burned to maintain body temperature and helps prevent insulin resistance. Cold water swimming boosts circulation, which is good for people with varicose veins, and promotes blood and lymph flow, aiding in venous insufficiency. It also benefits heart and lung health. Mental health advantages include lowered stress levels through the release of endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin, improving happiness. A 2020 study found that regular ice swimming in individuals aged 65 to 85 led to fewer respiratory infections and slower aging, attributed to less free radical production. However, for temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, proper training and equipment are necessary. Swimming in water temperatures between 15 and 21 degrees Celsius is generally healthier than in warmer waters. Slowly getting used to the water temperature is advised to prevent thermal shock, particularly for those with heart or lung issues. Extreme caution is recommended for young children and the elderly because they have more difficulty regulating their body temperature.",

    "summary": "A study by the Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Pere Virgili (IISPV) has found that adverse childhood experiences such as physical abuse, emotional maltreatment, or neglect can lead to a chemical change in the DNA, particularly in the DDR1 gene. This change, known as epigenetic modification, occurs more often under stressful conditions and is associated with the development of mental disorders like bipolar disorder. The study, part of the Bipogent project, involved 128 adults with bipolar disorder and 141 without any mental illness, and included clinical evaluations, psychological assessments, and blood samples. The DDR1 gene is important in brain cells known as oligodendrocytes, which insulate neurons with a myelin sheath, enabling quicker and more efficient information transfer. This discovery could pave the way for better, more tailored treatments for bipolar disorder in the future, using blood tests to assess the extent of the genetic change. The findings were published in the prestigious journal Molecular Psychiatry.",

These cognitive abilities include memory, concentration, and information processing, which, when impaired, affect the patient's psychosocial function - their ability to perform routine tasks and interact socially. The findings could lead to early detection of patients at higher risk of cognitive and psychosocial deterioration, allowing for more personalized and effective treatment to improve their quality of life. However, further research involving more patients with varied profiles is needed before these tests can be implemented clinically. The study analyzed 3,035 samples provided by CIBERSAM and aims to use the identified DDR1 gene variants, along with those from other studies, as a tool for early detection in health systems. This research was recently published in the journal \"Molecular Psychiatry\" and involved collaboration from nine CIBERSAM research groups.",

The study included 617 elderly individuals with a high cardiometabolic risk from across Spain, evaluating their Carbohydrate Quality Index (CQI) using validated food consumption questionnaires. This index takes into account aspects such as fiber content, whole grains, sugary drinks, and the glycemic index. Fecal samples were analyzed to assess the gut microbiota. The results showed that a diet rich in quality carbohydrates (high CQI) leads to a more diverse and abundant gut microbiota, which is linked to better cardiometabolic health and an increase in beneficial cardiovascular bacteria. Moreover, enhancing carbohydrate quality with a Mediterranean diet for a year resulted in a significant rise in healthy gut bacteria. This indicates that improving the quality of dietary carbohydrates can improve metabolism and cardiovascular health by influencing the gut microbiota, providing insights into creating specific diets for the betterment of metabolic health and for the prevention or reduction of disease.",

    "summary": "Spain ranks as the second country within the European Union for the best implementation of its childhood vaccination schedule, according to a study published in the Expert Review of Vaccines. This evaluation was carried out by a group of European vaccinologists, including a member from the Spanish Association of Vaccinology. The study assessed all vaccines included in childhood schedules, whether recommended or funded, and assigned scores based on 'basic', 'extended', and 'increased' categories. Despite Spain's high ranking, the study was conducted before the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in the country and did not consider the inclusion of monoclonal antibodies against the respiratory syncytial virus. The research aimed to examine the variation in the breadth of protection offered by National Immunization Programs (NIP) across Europe and proposed a framework for evaluating the comprehensiveness of pediatric NIPs in Europe. France, Italy, Latvia, and Spain were identified as countries with the most comprehensive NIPs. The study also aimed to initiate a discussion on the differences in NIP scores across countries and to promote the adoption of practices that could improve public health outcomes.",

The court's decision supports the claim of the Andalusian Federation of Health and Sociosanitary Sectors of CCOO that the selection processes did not adhere to principles of equality, merit, and capacity. The TSJA has ordered Faisem to redo the job postings through a procedure that guarantees these principles in public employment access. This ruling could affect around thirty job positions. The judgment comes after allegations of a \"customized\" selection process for certain positions, a practice denounced by the union organization. Additionally, it was revealed that since 2020, under new management, Faisem began a \"professional purification process,\" sidelining professionals who had obtained their positions through regulated public offers. The new selection process introduced in 2021 ignored previously agreed-upon selection processes with the union representation, leading to arbitrary appointments under the guise of legality.",

This change is due to the adaptation of the three Galician health research foundations to the regional public sector, after approving modifications in their statutes. The measure will affect 140 researchers and 374 technicians and administrative workers. The aim is to stabilize the staff through a decree, currently under review, which will include almost all research profiles, establishing their career path and adjusting salaries to those of civil servants, with the inclusion of triennials and quinquennials. Galicia positions itself as a pioneer in Spain with this regulation that maintains labor contracts without differences or losses, and allows researchers to become permanent staff after a merit competition and subsequent evaluation. The foundations will receive funding in the Galicia budgets for 2024, with specific allocations for each one.",

    "summary": "Heart failure is a growing cardiovascular disease, particularly affecting those over 65, leading to frequent hospital admissions due to patient decompensations. Julio N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a prominent figure in cardiology, emphasizes the importance of early identification and treatment of these decompensations to prevent hospitalizations and the subsequent strain on healthcare systems. Symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, abdominal swelling, difficulty breathing, swollen legs, and decreased urination are critical for patients to recognize. The future of treating heart failure may lie in outpatient management of decompensations to avoid hospital admissions. The disease's mortality rates are comparable to some common cancers, highlighting the severe impact on patients' quality and functional capacity. Lifestyle changes and risk factor management are essential for prevention, though the aging population presents ongoing challenges.",

She points out the scarcity of human resources in the specialty, with a significant number of pediatric positions unfilled, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, leading to excessive workloads for existing pediatricians. This situation is exacerbated by an aging workforce and a lack of new pediatricians choosing to work in primary care settings. Ruano emphasizes the importance of making the profession more attractive to new graduates and calls for better training in primary care during pediatric residency programs. She also mentions ongoing issues with the shortage of pediatric medications in pharmacies.

These advancements offer clinical benefits like the possibility of more frequent dialysis schedules compared to hospital hemodialysis, better hemodynamic tolerance, fewer dietary restrictions, and longer maintenance of residual renal function. Chronic kidney disease, affecting 15% of the adult population in Spain, is highlighted as a \"silent epidemic\" with a high rate of underdiagnosis. The number of people requiring renal replacement therapy has increased by 30% in the last decade, with 66,982 people in Spain on dialysis or having undergone a transplant.

    "summary": "In Spain, during the 2019/2020 flu season, there were 3,900 deaths directly attributed to influenza, over 600,000 primary care cases, and 27,000 hospitalizations. These alarming figures prompted five leading Spanish scientific societies to present a consensus document aimed at optimizing flu management. The document addresses clinical, microbiological, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of influenza for both pediatric and adult populations. It highlights the underuse of flu vaccines, with only 43% of pregnant women and 53% of those over 65 vaccinated. The consensus also discusses the importance of early antiviral treatment, specifically oseltamivir, to reduce hospitalization time, severe complications, and mortality. It calls for improved access to approved but not nationally funded antiviral drugs and emphasizes the need for vaccination, especially among vulnerable populations, to mitigate the flu's impact on morbidity and mortality.",

This situation, exacerbated by a streptococcus A outbreak, has forced healthcare professionals to resort to less-than-ideal alternatives. Scientific pediatric societies have highlighted this as a serious health issue for children and are calling for immediate action to address the shortage, which is partly attributed to Spain's medication price caps making certain drugs scarce as they fetch higher prices elsewhere. The shortage, affecting basic pediatric antibiotics like Amoxicillin and Augmentine, complicates medical consultations and treatment processes, with professionals urging for solutions beyond substituting drugs.",

It identifies gene expression profiles that create a dysfunctional environment, leading to scar tissue formation, inflammation, and vascular changes. The research involved patients diagnosed with moderate to severe Asherman's Syndrome, fertile women, and healthy donors as control groups. Additionally, endometrial organoids derived from affected patients and healthy women were created, displaying similar characteristics to in vivo endometrial tissue, suggesting their efficacy as an in vitro model for studying the syndrome. The analysis of over 200,000 cells from the endometrium of patients and healthy controls, along with advanced machine learning models, helped uncover transcriptomic differences between in vivo and in vitro endometrial cells of patients and controls, providing deeper insights into the endometrial microenvironment's alterations in the disease.

The study analyzed blood flow in 208 pregnant women's fetuses, using AI and computer models to examine changes in lung vascular resistance. It found that fetuses with restricted growth had different blood velocity and vascular resistance in the lungs compared to those with normal growth. Notably, giving extra oxygen to the mothers improved blood flow in the lungs of the restricted-growth fetuses, indicating a possible treatment to prevent respiratory issues in these newborns, with benefits extending into later life.

Although SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate, the widespread vaccination has effectively managed COVID-19, though children have a lower rate of vaccination. Respiratory illnesses, particularly those due to the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are common in the colder seasons, with infants under six months facing a greater risk of severe bronchiolitis complications. The healthcare system is strained with an increase in primary care visits and hospital admissions.

The goal is to immunize more than 1,350,000 people in a joint campaign that will also offer COVID-19 vaccines to those who qualify. The campaign seeks to protect the most vulnerable populations, with specific vaccination coverage goals for people over 65, healthcare and social health workers, pregnant women, and people with risk conditions. Additionally, a weakened intranasal vaccine will be introduced for children between 2 and 4 years old, and eligibility for the flu vaccine will be expanded to people over 60 and healthy children under five. The recommended COVID-19 vaccine is an mRNA vaccine based on the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain, following the recommendations of the WHO and the European Medicines Agency.",

This finding, presented on March 26 in conjunction with World Colon Cancer Day, marks a significant advancement in personalized oncology medicine, offering the potential for more effective treatments with fewer side effects. Additionally, the molecule MDL1AS, part of the long non-coding RNAs group, has been found to differentiate between tumor and healthy cells in colorectal cancer and shows promise for diagnosing other cancers such as breast and laryngeal cancer. High levels of this molecule at diagnosis were associated with improved five-year survival rates in advanced rectal cancer patients, highlighting its prognostic potential. The research has been published in the Cancers journal, contributing to the fight against one of the most common tumors in La Rioja, where early detection significantly enhances treatment and recovery chances.",

The research focuses on reducing the overprescription of antibiotics, especially for respiratory infections, by determining the effectiveness of rapid bivalent antigen tests (for COVID-19 and flu) in primary care patients with signs or symptoms of respiratory infection. This national multicenter clinical trial involves a controlled group of 350 patients and a randomized group of the same size, selecting 20 health centers across Spain. The study addresses the public health issue of antibiotic resistance and aims to minimize inappropriate prescriptions. The broader goal is to enhance the efficiency of primary care services, thereby improving prevention, early diagnosis, and disease control, which is crucial for tackling the challenge of antibiotic-resistant superbugs.",

Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant public health threat, causing 1.3 million deaths worldwide. Extremadura's role focuses on controlling and monitoring antimicrobial use in humans, animals, and the environment. The project aims to foster international cooperation, experience exchange, and establish antimicrobial surveillance strategies. Following the success of the original EU-JAMRAI project (2017-2021), EU-JAMRAI-2 promotes a comprehensive \"One Health\" work program involving EU member states, Iceland, Norway, Ukraine, and several European and global organizations to ensure project coherence with existing initiatives.",

This is a major step forward in HIV treatment research, indicating the possibility of a cure through gene editing and antiretroviral therapy.

The Spanish Society of Penitentiary Health highlights a nearly 70% shortfall in medical professionals needed for adequate care. Since the 2003 Law of Cohesion and Quality of the National Health System, healthcare in prisons was to be transferred to each region, but only Catalonia, the Basque Country, and Navarre have done so, leaving others, like Aragon, under the Ministry of the Interior. The doctor deficit has shifted focus from scheduled to urgent care, with telemedicine services partially filling the gap. This shortage hinders diagnosing and treating inmates, many with mental health issues and addictions, and a significant portion never accessed healthcare before incarceration.

The event, which took place at the Marqu\u00e9s de Valdecilla Foundation, aimed to thank the donors and promote this altruistic act. Health Minister C\u00e9sar Pascual emphasized the life-saving importance of breast milk donations for babies unable to be breastfed by their mothers. In 2023, 43 women donated over 200 liters of milk, producing more than 2,300 bottles. The donation process, including extraction, pasteurization, and storage, is highly secure, ensuring the milk's quality for the most vulnerable infants, such as preemies or those with specific illnesses. Women in good health and with established lactation can donate, with certain restrictions. The donated milk, which is anonymous and free, is prescribed by medical criteria.",

Currently, the average wait to access PrEP is nine months. PrEP is a prevention strategy involving antiretroviral medication taken before potential HIV exposure to prevent infection, intended for HIV-negative individuals at high risk of exposure. The medication, which is highly effective, uses two active components, emtricitabine and tenofovir, to block HIV from infecting cells. Although PrEP is safe and has low toxicity, it is not suitable for individuals already HIV-positive or those with kidney issues without closer medical supervision. Regular medical checks are recommended for those on PrEP to monitor any side effects and ensure effectiveness.",

Moyamoya disease, causing narrowed brain vessels and increased stroke risk, shows improved revascularization outcomes at these centers. Analyzing data from 125 pediatric patients between January 2018 and December 2020, the study highlighted that patients treated at Boston Children's experienced fewer complications and underwent fewer follow-up surgeries compared to those at lower-volume centers. This was partly due to the innovative single-anesthetic bilateral revascularization surgery, now recommended by the American Stroke Association. The study also noted a 42% cost reduction for treatments at high-volume centers by coordinating care with local clinicians, emphasizing the benefits of a partnership care model. This approach not only reduces costs but also minimizes out-of-network insurance exposure and family disruptions, suggesting a reevaluation of referral practices to prioritize high-volume centers for complex, rare conditions like moyamoya.",

In 2016, Darius Ebrahimi-Fakhari, a neurology fellow at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, started researching HSP after encountering two girls with a rare form, SPG47. With no treatments available, the families of the girls began research efforts, leading to the creation of a patient registry and the first comprehensive study of childhood-onset HSP. Ebrahimi-Fakhari's team found a potential oral medication that could treat various HSP forms, including SPG47, by fixing protein transport issues caused by the condition. This progress, combined with ongoing gene therapy trials for other forms, represents a major step forward in treating HSP. These efforts were significantly supported by patient advocacy and partnerships with biotech firms, underscoring the vital role of community and scientific collaboration in tackling rare diseases.",

The hospital's research indicates an increase in complex heart surgeries leading to a rise in postoperative heart block, necessitating pacemakers. This condition not only imposes a financial burden on families but also causes anxiety among children reliant on these devices. To address these issues, Boston Children's clinicians have developed two innovative approaches aimed at identifying conduction tissue during surgery to potentially decrease the incidence of heart block. One method involves a confocal microscope, which provides high-resolution images to help surgeons avoid damaging conduction tissue. The other is an electrophysiology tool used during surgery to accurately locate conduction tissue, which has already shown success in reducing heart block rates in specific patient groups. These innovations reflect the hospital's commitment to improving patient care by minimizing the need for pacemakers, thereby alleviating both the financial strain on families and the psychological impact on children.",

    "summary": "Remote monitoring technology is significantly benefiting patients and healthcare providers at Memorial Healthcare System. Jules Penn, a 73-year-old patient with heart failure, experienced a dramatic improvement in his condition through the use of a CardioMEM sensor implanted in his heart. This sensor allows for the remote transmission of vital data to his cardiology team, enabling early detection and management of potential issues. Memorial Healthcare System has connected with over 800 patients, utilizing various remote monitoring devices that integrate directly with patients' electronic medical records, thereby eliminating the need for manual data transmission. This approach has led to nearly 50% reduction in hospital admissions, over 22% decrease in readmissions, 27% fewer emergency department visits, and increased primary care visits. The system has saved more than $4 million in hospital and emergency services, emphasizing the value of remote patient monitoring in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.",
